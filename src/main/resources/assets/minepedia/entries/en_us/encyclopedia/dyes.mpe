Dye is used to change the color of many things in Minecraft.

Some Dye materials are harder to find than others. Most Dyes can be crafted from flowers, like §eRed Dye§f from a Poppy, but some Dyes are found or created in more obscure ways such as:

§eBlack Dye§f - Collecting Ink Sacs from Squids

§eBlue Dye§f - Mining Lapis Lazuli deep underground

§eBrown Dye§f - Harvesting Cocoa Beans in the Jungle

§eGreen Dye§f - Smelted from Cactus

§eWhite Dye§f - Crafted from Bone Meal
