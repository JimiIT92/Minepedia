A soft bed lets you sleep through the night.
You'll need wool to craft one, as well as a safe spot to place it.

Sleeping in a bed will also set your §espawn point§f, meaning that if you die, you'll reappear right back home!

You can only fall asleep when it's cosy, like when it's nighttime or during a thunderstorm.
