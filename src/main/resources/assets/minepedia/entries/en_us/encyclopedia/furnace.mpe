A Furnace allows you to cook or smelt items.
For example, you can smelt Iron Ore into Iron Ingots.

Place the Furnace in the world and press {{ctrl.use}} to use it.

You need to put some fuel into the bottom of the Furnace, and the item that you want smelted in the top. The Furnace will then fire up and start working. Lots of things can be used as fuel: try experimenting with anything burnable!
