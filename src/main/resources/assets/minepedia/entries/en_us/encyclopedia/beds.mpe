Sleeping in a Bed passes the night and sets your spawn point.

Press {{ctrl.use}} on a Bed to go to sleep. This can only be done at night.

If you are playing Multiplayer, everyone in the world must be in a Bed at the same time to pass the night.

If your Bed is broken you will return to where you first spawned into the world.

Be careful when using a Bed in the Nether, it's usually too hot to sleep.
