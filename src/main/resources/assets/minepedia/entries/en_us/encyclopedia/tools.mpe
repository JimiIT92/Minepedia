There are many tools in Minecraft that will allow you mine blocks faster than your fist.
Tools can be crafted from Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond or Netherite.

Using the right tool for the job will not only mine that block faster, but will also lose less durability. More complex tools must be created in order to mine rare resources.

§8§l§nTools that Break Stuff§f§r

The Pickaxe is good at breaking hard blocks like Cobblestone, Iron or Furnaces.

The Axe is good at breaking wooden blocks like Logs, Planks or Crafting Tables.

The Shovel is good at breaking loose blocks like Dirt, Sand, and Gravel. Shovels can also create a path by pressing {{ctrl.use}} on grass blocks.

The Hoe is required for tilling Dirt to plant crops. Press {{ctrl.use}} on Dirt or Grass blocks to turn them into Farmland.

All of these tools can accept enchantments, either from the Enchanting Table or Anvil.
