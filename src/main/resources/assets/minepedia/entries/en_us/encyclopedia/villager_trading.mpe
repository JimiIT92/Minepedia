Trading can be done in villages. Each villager has a profession: they can be Farmers, Butchers, Blacksmiths, Cartographers, Librarians or Priests. Some professions will trade for items that other professions cannot. Explore and trade with many villagers to find all the trades.

You can find out what a villager is offering as trade by interacting with them. A villager may adjust the price of a trade whenever a player trades with it. A villager may run out of stock, temporarily disabling the trade if it is used too frequently. Trades usually involve buying or selling items for emeralds.

As you trade with villagers, they will get better at their profession and start to offer better and more valuable trades.

Take care of your villagers, they need to rest, work and eat to thrive.
