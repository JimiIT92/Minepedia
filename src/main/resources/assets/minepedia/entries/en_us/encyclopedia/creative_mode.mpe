Creative Mode is there so you can build the land of your dreams mob free!

§8§l§nUnlimited Building§f§r

The creative mode interface allows any item in the game to be moved into the player's inventory without the need for mining or crafting the item. The items in the player's inventory will not be removed when they are placed or used in the world, and this allows the player to focus on building rather than resource gathering.

To fly faster, push {{ctrl.up}} twice in rapid succession or press {{ctrl.sprint}} while flying. When in flying mode, you can hold down {{ctrl.jump}} to move up and {{ctrl.sneak}} to move down.
