Resources you pick up will appear in your §ehotbar§f, which you'll find at the bottom of the screen.

To hold an item in your hand, scroll the mouse wheel to select the item.
You can also use a number key: {{ctrl.hotbar.first}} is the fist hotbar slot and {{ctrl.hotbar.last}} is the last.

Some items, like buckets, fishing rods and bows, can be used by tapping the build/use button {{ctrl.use}}.
