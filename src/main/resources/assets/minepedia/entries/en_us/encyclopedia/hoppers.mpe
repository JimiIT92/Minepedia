Hoppers are used to automatically move items.
Hoppers can be attached to some other items like containers such as Chests or Jukeboxes.

Hoppers will continuously remove items out of a container placed above them and move them into the container they are pointing to.

To make a Hopper point to a particular block, place the Hopper against that block while sneaking.

If a Hopper is powered by Redstone, it will become inactive and stop moving items.
