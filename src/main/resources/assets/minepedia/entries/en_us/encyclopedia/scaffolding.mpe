§8§l§nReach for the Sky§f§r

Scaffolding can help you create huge structures safely! You can walk inside scaffolding and stand on it. If you have a column of scaffolding you can go upwards by standing in the scaffolding and pressing {{ctrl.jump}}. If you want to travel downwards, you can press {{ctrl.sneak}}

§8§l§nSupport Your Build§f§r

Scaffolding needs support. You can only place so many scaffolding horizontally without touching a different block. When you attempt to place too many scaffolding blocks without proper support, it will fall.
Scaffolding can be placed like normal blocks, but it can also be placed on its own foundation to quickly build a tall tower.
