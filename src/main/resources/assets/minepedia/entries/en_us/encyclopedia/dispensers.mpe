Dispensers are used to shoot out items. You will need to power each Dispenser with a redstone signal (for example, with a lever) to trigger it.

To fill a Dispenser with items, press {{ctrl.use}} on the Dispenser, then move the items that you want to dispense from your inventory to the Dispenser.

Whenever you power a Dispenser, an item will shoot out.

Dispensers can also be used to place items as well, such as Pumpkins on Iron Golems and equipment on Armor Stands.
